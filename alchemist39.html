          The next day, the boy returned to the well, hoping to see the girl.
To his surprise, the Englishman was there, looking out at the desert.
“I waited all afternoon and evening,” he said. “He appeared with
the first stars of evening. I told him what I was seeking, and he
asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold. I told him that
was what I had come here to learn.
“He told me I should try to do so. That’s all he said: ‘Go and try.’”
The boy didn’t say anything. The poor Englishman had traveled
all this way, only to be told that he should repeat what he had
already done so many times.
“So, then try,” he said to the Englishman.
“That’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to start now.”
As the Englishman left, Fatima arrived and filled her vessel with
water.
“I came to tell you just one thing,” the boy said. “I want you to be
my wife. I love you.”
The girl dropped the container, and the water spilled.
“I’m going to wait here for you every day. I have crossed the
desert in search of a treasure that is somewhere near the Pyramids,
and for me, the war seemed a curse. But now it’s a blessing, because
it brought me to you.”
“The war is going to end someday,” the girl said.
The boy looked around him at the date palms. He reminded
himself that he had been a shepherd, and that he could be a
shepherd again. Fatima was more important than his treasure.
“The tribesmen are always in search of treasure,” the girl said, as
if she had guessed what he was thinking. “And the women of the
desert are proud of their tribesmen.”
She refilled her vessel and left.
The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima. He told
her about his life as a shepherd, about the king, and about the
crystal shop. They became friends, and except for the fifteen
minutes he spent with her, each day seemed that it would never
pass. When he had been at the oasis for almost a month, the leader
of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with
him.
“We don’t know when the war will end, so we can’t continue our
journey,” he said. “The battles may last for a long time, perhaps even
years. There are powerful forces on both sides, and the war is
important to both armies. It’s not a battle of good against evil. It’s a
war between forces that are fighting for the balance of power, and,
when that type of battle begins, it lasts longer than others—because
Allah is on both sides.”
The people went back to where they were living, and the boy
went to meet with Fatima that afternoon. He told her about the
morning’s meeting. “The day after we met,” Fatima said, “you told
me that you loved me. Then, you taught me something of the
universal language and the Soul of the World. Because of that, I have
become a part of you.”
The boy listened to the sound of her voice, and thought it to be
more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms.
“I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time. I
have forgotten about my past, about my traditions, and the way in
which men of the desert expect women to behave. Ever since I was a
child, I have dreamed that the desert would bring me a wonderful
present. Now, my present has arrived, and it’s you.”
The boy wanted to take her hand. But Fatima’s hands held to the
handles of her jug.
